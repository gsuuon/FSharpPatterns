- new state-machine machinery implemented for F# 6.0 tasks
- record of functions vs interface
    - record of functions ok if 'closed'
    - interface more composable
        - single object can implement many interfaces
        - if type annotations were required in consumers, record of functions changes will require more annotation changes
